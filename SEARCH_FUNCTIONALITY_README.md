The global search bar in the header has been successfully implemented with dropdown results showing the top 3 matching events.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Search Input

- Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- Minimum 2 characters required to trigger search
- Loading spinner during search

### 2. Search Results Dropdown

  - **Food & Culture Fair** (Food Festivals)

## How to Test

### Basic Search
1. Navigate to any page with the header (http://localhost:5174)
2. Click on the search bar in the top-right area
3. Type any of these search terms:
   - "tech" → Shows Tech Innovation Summit
   - "music" → Shows Music Festival
   - "food" → Shows Food & Culture Fair
   - "festival" → Shows multiple matching events

### Search Behavior
- **Less than 2 characters**: No search performed
- **2+ characters**: Search triggered after 300ms delay
- **No results**: Shows "No events found" message
- **Results found**: Shows clickable event cards

### Event Interaction
- **Real events**: Navigate to event detail page
- **Demo events**: Show alert (for demonstration)
- **View all results**: Navigate to events page with search filter

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/global/Header.jsx` - Main search functionality
- Added search state management
- Integrated with eventsAPI.searchEvents()
- Fallback to demo data when API returns no results

### Search Algorithm
- Searches event name, description, and categories
- Case-insensitive matching
- Returns top 3 most relevant results
- Sorted by relevance and popularity

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive dropdown design
- Loading states with spinner
- Keyboard navigation ready
- Click-outside to close dropdown
- Clean, accessible interface

## API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/events/search?q={query}&limit=3`
- **Fallback**: Demo events when API unavailable
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation to local data

## Future Enhancements
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter)
- Search history/suggestions
- Advanced filters in dropdown
- Real-time event data from database
- Search analytics and tracking
