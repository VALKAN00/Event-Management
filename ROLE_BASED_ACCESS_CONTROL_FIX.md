# Role-Based Access Control - Testing Guide

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

The issue where the sidebar remained in "admin mode" after switching from admin to user account has been resolved with the following improvements:

### **1. Component Re-rendering**
- Added a unique `key` prop to the Sidebar component based on user ID/email
- This forces a complete re-render when the user changes

### **2. AuthContext Integration**
- Updated Login component to properly call `login()` from AuthContext
- Added `refreshUser()` method to AuthContext for manual user data refresh
- Added localStorage event listener for cross-tab synchronization

### **3. Sidebar State Management**
- Added `useEffect` in Sidebar to reset state when user role changes
- Proper cleanup of modal states when user switches
- Debug logging to track user role changes

### **4. Logout Process**
- Updated logout to use AuthContext `logout()` method for consistent state management
- Ensures all components receive the user state change

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Admin User Experience**
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Verify sidebar shows:
   - ✅ Dashboard
   - ✅ Manage Events  
   - ✅ Booking & Tickets
   - ✅ Attendee Insights
   - ✅ Analytics & Reports
   - ✅ Additional Features section
   - ✅ Manage Users
   - ✅ Add Quick Event button

### **Test 2: Regular User Experience**
1. Login with regular user credentials (`role: 'user'`)
2. Verify sidebar shows:
   - ✅ Manage Events
   - ✅ Booking & Tickets (default landing page)
   - ✅ Contact Support
   - ✅ Notifications  
   - ✅ Settings
   - ❌ Dashboard (hidden)
   - ❌ Attendee Insights (hidden)
   - ❌ Analytics & Reports (hidden)
   - ❌ Additional Features section (hidden)
   - ❌ Manage Users (hidden)
   - ❌ Add Quick Event button (hidden)

### **Test 3: Account Switching (The Main Fix)**
1. Login as admin user
2. Verify full admin sidebar is visible
3. Logout and login as regular user
4. **Verify sidebar immediately updates** (no refresh needed)
5. Sidebar should show only user-accessible items
6. Reverse test: Login as user, then switch to admin

### **Test 4: URL Protection**
Try accessing admin URLs directly as a regular user:
- `http://localhost:5174/dashboard` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`
- `http://localhost:5174/attendee-insights` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`
- `http://localhost:5174/reports-dashboard` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`
- `http://localhost:5174/manage-users` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`
- `http://localhost:5174/marketing` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`
- `http://localhost:5174/event-categories` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`

### **Test 5: Default Route Behavior**
- Admin accessing `http://localhost:5174/` → Shows Dashboard
- User accessing `http://localhost:5174/` → Redirects to `/booking-tickets`

## 🎯 **Key Improvements Made**

1. **Instant UI Updates**: No more manual refresh needed when switching accounts
2. **Proper State Management**: AuthContext properly manages user state across all components  
3. **Security**: URL protection prevents unauthorized access
4. **User Experience**: Clean sidebar interface based on user role
5. **Cross-tab Sync**: Changes in one tab reflect in other tabs

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified:**
- `Sidebar.jsx` - Role-based rendering + state reset
- `App.jsx` - Added AdminRoute protection + unique sidebar key
- `Login.jsx` - Proper AuthContext integration
- `AuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced with refreshUser and storage listeners
- `AdminRoute.jsx` - New component for admin-only protection
- `DefaultRoute.jsx` - Smart default routing based on role

### **Components Created:**
- `AdminRoute` - Protects admin-only routes
- `DefaultRoute` - Handles smart default routing

The role-based access control is now fully functional and properly handles account switching! 🚀
