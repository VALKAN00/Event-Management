## Export CSV - All Events Issue Fixed

### ❌ **Previous Problem:**
- Export only showed events owned by the current user
- Filter: `'eventData.organizer': req.user._id`
- Missing events from other organizers

### ✅ **Fixed Solution:**

#### **Admin Users (Role: 'admin'):**
- **See ALL events** regardless of organizer
- **Export ALL bookings** from all events
- **Get complete attendee data** across the platform

#### **Regular Users (Role: 'user'):**
- See only their own events
- Export only their event bookings
- Get attendee data from their events only

### 🔧 **Technical Changes:**

#### **Events Export:**
```javascript
// Before: Only user's events
{ organizer: req.user.id, isActive: true }

// After: Admin sees all, users see their own
const eventFilter = req.user.role === 'admin' 
  ? { isActive: true } 
  : { organizer: req.user.id, isActive: true };
```

#### **Attendees Export:**
```javascript
// Before: Only user's events
{ 'eventData.organizer': req.user._id }

// After: Role-based filtering
...(req.user.role === 'admin' ? {} : { 'eventData.organizer': req.user._id })
```

### 📊 **Enhanced CSV Formats:**

#### **Events CSV Headers:**
- Event Name, Event Date, Venue Name, Venue City
- Status, Total Bookings, Revenue, Capacity
- Organizer, Created Date

#### **Bookings CSV Headers:**
- Booking ID, Event Name, User Name, User Email
- Booking Date, Total Amount, Payment Method, Status, Seats Count

#### **Attendees CSV Headers:**
- Event Name, Event Date, Event Venue, Event City
- Attendee Name, Email, Phone, Gender, Location, Country
- Interests, Booking Date, Total Amount, Payment Method, Status

### 🧪 **Testing:**

#### **As Admin User:**
1. Go to Analytics → Export CSV
2. Select "Event Performance" → Should show ALL events
3. Select "Attendee Report" → Should show ALL attendees
4. Select "Bookings" → Should show ALL bookings

#### **As Regular User:**
1. Go to Analytics → Export CSV
2. Select "Event Performance" → Shows only your events
3. Select "Attendee Report" → Shows only your event attendees
4. Select "Bookings" → Shows only your event bookings

### 🎯 **Expected Results:**

**Admin Export will now include:**
- ✅ All events from all organizers
- ✅ All bookings across the platform
- ✅ Complete attendee demographics
- ✅ Cross-organizer analytics data

**User Export will include:**
- ✅ Only events they organized
- ✅ Only bookings for their events
- ✅ Only attendees from their events
- ✅ Their event-specific analytics

---

**🔑 Key:** The export now respects user roles - admins get platform-wide data, regular users get their own data only.
